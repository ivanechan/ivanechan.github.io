								<p>Nowadays, mobile data traffic grows explosively. According to Cisco’s annual Visual Networking Index forecast (VNI) released earlier 2016, the mobile data traffic has been grown 400-million-fold over the past 15 years. The forecast predicted that over 75% of global mobile data traffic will be video content by 2020, which is 55% in 2015; and there will be 7 trillion video clips uploaded in 2020. From here we can know that online video consumption is a trend. the video quality has been improved greatly this recent years. Apart from the quality, 360 degree video is another direction to enhance user’s watching experience. While nowadays, there are still not many 360 video platforms.</p> 

								<p>This is demo for a 360 video platform.</p>

								<h4>Video player viewing angle rotation  </h4>

								<p>Simply the video can be rotate when user click and drag the mouse. Apart from the mouse, the player can also be control the the keyboard, using the arrow keys to preform viewing angle rotation, using the key code to update the X-asix and Y-asix location, to update the the viewing angle position.</p>

								<h4>Zoom in/out  </h4>

								<p>Mouse scrollwheel is used to control the zooming of the video content. </p>

								<h4>Comment box with Speech recognition</h4>

								<p>Speech recognition into the comment box function, To allow user to use spoken word to input their comment, it will be more convenient when they are watching the 360 video, it could be more interesting than typing words.</p>

								<h4>Problem remain</h4>
								<p>For mobile 360 video, the UI of video operations are still not convenient. Generally, when we watch the 360 video, we are taking advantage of the gyroscope sensor to rotate the viewing angle to change direction and using finger tap to perform play and pause. However, when watching with cardboard or headset, if users want to view video in the opposite viewing angle, they need to turn the whole body around, this large angled frequent turning will have heavy pressure to the neck, it is a potential health problem, and also it is different to perform play and pause operations.</p>

								<h4>Future Improvement: </h4>
								<p>To implement a smooth and convenient operations input, one of the direction is adding more hardware, e.g. the VR Controller or the Leap Motion Controller and the Universal VR Developer Mount set. Using Leap Motion is a good direction for future improvement, firstly, by using gesture recognition, more operations can be coded, and audience can easily perform play, pause and other interactive operations. Secondly, Leap Motion can provide a more immersive video experience even it’s not a game environment, audience cannot change the video content but the hand model will be display in the screen.</p>

								<h4>Other type of control </h4>
								<p>As I mentioned, for the 360 video web player, most of the input operations are from the mouse cursor or the keyboard, but it is not a convenient to perform video watching operation. If voice recognition or eye motion tracking can be added in the player to perform play and pause or other interactive activities. E.g. use voice command for viewing angle rotation, or a half transparent comment box located in the corner of the player, user can directly use voice to communicate with other user who are watching the same video.</p>

								<h4>Live 360 streaming</h4>
								<p>Another improvement is live 360 streaming. Comparing with watching 360 video in a video-on-demand platform, live 360 video is a more challenging and large project, besides higher hardware requirement, the most challenging part is the real-time video stitching process, as 360 videos are often created with up to 16+ individual 4k cameras, the stitching process is a computationally intensive operation. Also, to ensure a smooth outcome, there are many key elements are considered in the stitching process: continuity between shots, mismatched color and exposure across cameras. It is important to automate this process by improving the stitching algorithm.
